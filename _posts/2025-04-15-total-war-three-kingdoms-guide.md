When playing Total War Three kingdoms, we will have two parts to manage: military and internal affairs. In this guide, I will sequentially explain each part. I will skip some factors and basic knowledge that you might already know and prioritize the more significant components that have a greater impact.

#### I. Internal Affairs
Income is a crucial factor to ensure sustainability and strength for building the military.

There are 5 types of buildings corresponding to 5 different colors:
- The purple buildings is industrial, with a high basic income, but receives less bonus.
- The blue buildings is commercial, with an average basic income, receiving many bonuses from other buildings.
- The green buildings is an agricultural house, with low income, mainly for producing food to supply other cities.
- Red buildings for military purposes, these types of buildings are not encouraged to be used much.
- Yellow buildings for security, we also don't encourage using these types of buildings much.

Depending on the district advantages you own, we will build and upgrade the corresponding types of buildings to maximize productivity.

The district has an advantage in agriculture, so we only upgrade it to level 5 at most; at level 5, it will be less affected by public order penalties.
- Focus on building agricultural support buildings and food production buildings.
- There are two empty slots where we can build as we wish; here we encourage building an industrial house to increase income and a court to increase Prestige, reducing adjacent corruption when we own many districts.

Districts with advantages in commerce and industry can be upgraded to level 8 to obtain 6 building slots.
- Focus on building income-generating and income-supporting buildings.
- Reserve 1 slot to build an outpost to ensure public order does not drop below zero and have garrison troops to prevent rebellions.
- Can optionally build a court when necessary

##### No matter which district it is, first try to build a population development house to benefit from troop recovery and income bonus, then we can replace it later.
##### Priority should be given to appointing governor to generals who have 6 units of soldiers in fortresses that are likely to be attacked to increase defense capability; the governors will not incur upkeep costs.

#### II. Military
There are 5 types of generals corresponding to different abilities and roles in the army.
- The commander of the army should be a green or red general to gain many accompanying effects when being the commander (increased recovery, marching range, etc.).
The type of weapon used by the general also affects their combat efficiency; generals wielding long weapons (Glaives, Spears, great hammers, great axes, etc.) will eliminate soldiers faster than those wielding short weapons (single swords, double swords, single axes, double axes, halberds, etc.). Red, green, and purple generals are usually the ones capable of wielding long weapons:
- The red general is suitable for raids, so they should ride a horse with high mass to increase charge effectiveness.
- The green general has high armor, health and skills suitable for fighting soldiers.
- Purple generals with high evasion prioritize weapons with high damage and speed for duels, or choose long-range weapons to support killing soldiers.
- Yellow and blue champions with weak combat abilities are usually placed at the back to provide support when necessary.
